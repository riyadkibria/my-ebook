## Chapter 7: Using Closures


Up to this point, we’ve focused on the ins and outs of lexical scope, and how that affects the organization and usage of variables in our programs.

Our attention again shifts broader in abstraction, to the historically somewhat daunting topic of closure. Don’t worry! You don’t need an advanced computer science degree to make sense of it. Our broad goal in this book is not merely to understand scope, but to more effectively use it in the structure of our programs; closure is central to that effort.

Recall the main conclusion of Chapter 6: the least exposure principle (POLE) encourages us to use block (and function) scoping to limit the scope exposure of variables. This helps keep code understandable and maintainable, and helps avoid many scoping pitfalls (i.e., name collision, etc.).

Closure builds on this approach: for variables we need to use over time, instead of placing them in larger outer scopes, we can encapsulate (more narrowly scope) them but still preserve access from inside functions, for broader use. Functions remember these referenced scoped variables via closure.

We already saw an example of this kind of closure in the previous chapter (factorial(..) in Chapter 6), and you’ve almost certainly already used it in your own programs. If you’ve ever written a callback that accesses variables outside its own scope… guess what!? That’s closure.

Closure is one of the most important language characteristics ever invented in programming—it underlies major programming paradigms, including Functional Programming (FP), modules, and even a bit of class-oriented design. Getting comfortable with closure is required for mastering JS and effectively leveraging many important design patterns throughout your code.

Addressing all aspects of closure requires a daunting mountain of discussion and code throughout this chapter. Make sure to take your time and ensure you’re comfortable with each bit before moving onto the next.
