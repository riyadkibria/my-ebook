## Finally Initialized


Working with variables has much more nuance than it seems at first glance. Hoisting, (re)declaration, and the TDZ are common sources of confusion for developers, especially those who have worked in other languages before coming to JS. Before moving on, make sure your mental model is fully grounded on these aspects of JS scope and variables.

Hoisting is generally cited as an explicit mechanism of the JS engine, but it’s really more a metaphor to describe the various ways JS handles variable declarations during compilation. But even as a metaphor, hoisting offers useful structure for thinking about the life-cycle of a variable—when it’s created, when it’s available to use, when it goes away.

Declaration and re-declaration of variables tend to cause confusion when thought of as runtime operations. But if you shift to compile-time thinking for these operations, the quirks and shadows diminish.

The TDZ (temporal dead zone) error is strange and frustrating when encountered. Fortunately, TDZ is relatively straightforward to avoid if you’re always careful to place let/const declarations at the top of any scope.

As you successfully navigate these twists and turns of variable scope, the next chapter will lay out the factors that guide our decisions to place our declarations in various scopes, especially nested blocks.
