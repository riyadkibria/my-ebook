## Least Exposure


It makes sense that functions define their own scopes. But why do we need blocks to create scopes as well?

Software engineering articulates a fundamental discipline, typically applied to software security, called “The Principle of Least Privilege” (POLP). 1 And a variation of this principle that applies to our current discussion is typically labeled as “Least Exposure” (POLE).

POLP expresses a defensive posture to software architecture: components of the system should be designed to function with least privilege, least access, least exposure. If each piece is connected with minimum-necessary capabilities, the overall system is stronger from a security standpoint, because a compromise or failure of one piece has a minimized impact on the rest of the system.

If POLP focuses on system-level component design, the POLE Exposure variant focuses on a lower level; we’ll apply it to how scopes interact with each other.

In following POLE, what do we want to minimize the exposure of? Simply: the variables registered in each scope.

Think of it this way: why shouldn’t you just place all the variables of your program out in the global scope? That probably immediately feels like a bad idea, but it’s worth considering why that is. When variables used by one part of the program are exposed to another part of the program, via scope, there are three main hazards that often arise:

Naming Collisions: if you use a common and useful variable/function name in two different parts of the program, but the identifier comes from one shared scope (like the global scope), then name collision occurs, and it’s very likely that bugs will occur as one part uses the variable/function in a way the other part doesn’t expect.

For example, imagine if all your loops used a single global i index variable, and then it happens that one loop in a function is running during an iteration of a loop from another function, and now the shared i variable gets an unexpected value.

Unexpected Behavior: if you expose variables/functions whose usage is otherwise private to a piece of the program, it allows other developers to use them in ways you didn’t intend, which can violate expected behavior and cause bugs.

For example, if your part of the program assumes an array contains all numbers, but someone else’s code accesses and modifies the array to include booleans and strings, your code may then misbehave in unexpected ways.

Worse, exposure of private details invites those with mal-intent to try to work around limitations you have imposed, to do things with your part of the software that shouldn’t be allowed.

Unintended Dependency: if you expose variables/functions unnecessarily, it invites other developers to use and depend on those otherwise private pieces. While that doesn’t break your program today, it creates a refactoring hazard in the future, because now you cannot as easily refactor that variable or function without potentially breaking other parts of the software that you don’t control.

For example, if your code relies on an array of numbers, and you later decide it’s better to use some other data structure instead of an array, you now must take on the liability of adjusting other affected parts of the software.

POLE, as applied to variable/function scoping, essentially says, default to exposing the bare minimum necessary, keeping everything else as private as possible. Declare variables in as small and deeply nested of scopes as possible, rather than placing everything in the global (or even outer function) scope.

If you design your software accordingly, you have a much greater chance of avoiding (or at least minimizing) these three hazards.

In this diff(..) function, we want to ensure that y is greater than or equal to x, so that when we subtract (y - x), the result is 0 or larger. If x is initially larger (the result would be negative!), we swap x and y using a tmp variable, to keep the result positive.

In this simple example, it doesn’t seem to matter whether tmp is inside the if block or whether it belongs at the function level—it certainly shouldn’t be a global variable! However, following the POLE principle, tmp should be as hidden in scope as possible. So we block scope tmp (using let) to the if block.
