## A Word About Memory


I want to share a little quick note about this closure cache technique and the impacts it has on your application’s performance.

We can see that in saving the repeated calls, we improve computation speed (in some cases, by a dramatic amount). But this usage of closure is making an explicit trade-off that you should be very aware of.

The trade-off is memory. We’re essentially growing our cache (in memory) unboundedly. If the functions in question were called many millions of times with mostly unique inputs, we’d be chewing up a lot of memory. This can definitely be worth the expense, but only if we think it’s likely we see repetition of common inputs so that we’re taking advantage of the cache.

If most every call will have a unique input, and the cache is essentially never used to any benefit, this is an inappropriate technique to employ.

It also might be a good idea to have a more sophisticated caching approach, such as an LRU (least recently used) cache, that limits its size; as it runs up to the limit, an LRU evicts the values that are… well, least recently used!

The downside here is that LRU is quite non-trivial in its own right. You’ll want to use a highly optimized implementation of LRU, and be keenly aware of all the trade-offs at play.
