## Chapter 2: Illustrating Lexical Scope


In Chapter 1, we explored how scope is determined during code compilation, a model called “lexical scope.” The term “lexical” refers to the first stage of compilation (lexing/parsing).

To properly reason about our programs, it’s important to have a solid conceptual foundation of how scope works. If we rely on guesses and intuition, we may accidentally get the right answers some of the time, but many other times we’re far off. This isn’t a recipe for success.

Like way back in grade school math class, getting the right answer isn’t enough if we don’t show the correct steps to get there! We need to build accurate and helpful mental models as foundation moving forward.

This chapter will illustrate scope with several metaphors. The goal here is to think about how your program is handled by the JS engine in ways that more closely align with how the JS engine actually works.
