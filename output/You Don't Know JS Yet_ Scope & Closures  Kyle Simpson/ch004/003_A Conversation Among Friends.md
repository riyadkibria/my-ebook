## A Conversation Among Friends


Another useful metaphor for the process of analyzing variables and the scopes they come from is to imagine various conversations that occur inside the engine as code is processed and then executed. We can “listen in” on these conversations to get a better conceptual foundation for how scopes work.

Let’s now meet the members of the JS engine that will have conversations as they process our program:

Engine: responsible for start-to-finish compilation and execution of our JavaScript program.

Compiler: one of Engine’s friends; handles all the dirty work of parsing and code-generation (see previous section).

Scope Manager: another friend of Engine; collects and maintains a lookup list of all the declared variables/identifiers, and enforces a set of rules as to how these are accessible to currently executing code.

For you to fully understand how JavaScript works, you need to begin to think like Engine (and friends) think, ask the questions they ask, and answer their questions likewise.

To explore these conversations, recall again our running program example:

Let’s examine how JS is going to process that program, specifically starting with the first statement. The array and its contents are just basic JS value literals (and thus unaffected by any scoping concerns), so our focus here will be on the var students = [ .. ] declaration and initialization-assignment parts.

We typically think of that as a single statement, but that’s not how our friend Engine sees it. In fact, JS treats these as two distinct operations, one which Compiler will handle during compilation, and the other which Engine will handle during execution.

The first thing Compiler will do with this program is perform lexing to break it down into tokens, which it will then parse into a tree (AST).

Once Compiler gets to code generation, there’s more detail to consider than may be obvious. A reasonable assumption would be that Compiler will produce code for the first statement such as: “Allocate memory for a variable, label it students, then stick a reference to the array into that variable.” But that’s not the whole story.

Here’s the steps Compiler will follow to handle that statement:

Encountering var students, Compiler will ask Scope Manager to see if a variable named students already exists for that particular scope bucket. If so, Compiler would ignore this declaration and move on. Otherwise, Compiler will produce code that (at execution time) asks Scope Manager to create a new variable called students in that scope bucket.

Compiler then produces code for Engine to later execute, to handle the students = [] assignment. The code Engine runs will first ask Scope Manager if there is a variable called students accessible in the current scope bucket. If not, Engine keeps looking elsewhere (see “Nested Scope” below). Once Engine finds a variable, it assigns the reference of the [ .. ] array to it.

In conversational form, the first phase of compilation for the program might play out between Compiler and Scope Manager like this:

Compiler: Hey, Scope Manager (of the global scope), I found a formal declaration for an identifier called students, ever heard of it?

(Global) Scope Manager: Nope, never heard of it, so I just created it for you.

Compiler: Hey, Scope Manager, I found a formal declaration for an identifier called getStudentName, ever heard of it?

(Global) Scope Manager: Nope, but I just created it for you.

Compiler: Hey, Scope Manager, getStudentName points to a function, so we need a new scope bucket.

(Function) Scope Manager: Got it, here’s the scope bucket.

Compiler: Hey, Scope Manager (of the function), I found a formal parameter declaration for studentID, ever heard of it?

(Function) Scope Manager: Nope, but now it’s created in this scope.

Compiler: Hey, Scope Manager (of the function), I found a for-loop that will need its own scope bucket.

The conversation is a question-and-answer exchange, where Compiler asks the current Scope Manager if an encountered identifier declaration has already been encountered. If “no,” Scope Manager creates that variable in that scope. If the answer is “yes,” then it’s effectively skipped over since there’s nothing more for that Scope Manager to do.

Compiler also signals when it runs across functions or block scopes, so that a new scope bucket and Scope Manager can be instantiated.

Later, when it comes to execution of the program, the conversation will shift to Engine and Scope Manager, and might play out like this:

Engine: Hey, Scope Manager (of the global scope), before we begin, can you look up the identifier getStudentName so I can assign this function to it?

(Global) Scope Manager: Yep, here’s the variable.

Engine: Hey, Scope Manager, I found a target reference for students, ever heard of it?

(Global) Scope Manager: Yes, it was formally declared for this scope, so here it is.

Engine: Thanks, I’m initializing students to undefined, so it’s ready to use.

Hey, Scope Manager (of the global scope), I found a target reference for nextStudent, ever heard of it?

(Global) Scope Manager: Yes, it was formally declared for this scope, so here it is.

Engine: Thanks, I’m initializing nextStudent to undefined, so it’s ready to use.

Hey, Scope Manager (of the global scope), I found a source reference for getStudentName, ever heard of it?

(Global) Scope Manager: Yes, it was formally declared for this scope. Here it is.

Engine: Great, the value in getStudentName is a function, so I’m going to execute it.

Engine: Hey, Scope Manager, now we need to instantiate the function’s scope.

This conversation is another question-and-answer exchange, where Engine first asks the current Scope Manager to look up the hoisted getStudentName identifier, so as to associate the function with it. Engine then proceeds to ask Scope Manager about the target reference for students, and so on.

To review and summarize how a statement like var students = [ .. ] is processed, in two distinct steps:

Compiler sets up the declaration of the scope variable (since it wasn’t previously declared in the current scope).

While Engine is executing, to process the assignment part of the statement, Engine asks Scope Manager to look up the variable, initializes it to undefined so it’s ready to use, and then assigns the array value to it.
